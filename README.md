An m-Health Tool as an Android application

Amulet is an Android application that was created for a Mobile Devices and Applications module while attending the University of Hull. Its theoretical use was an m-Health tool to help researchers at the university discover ways in which people can self-moderate their alcohol consumption. A breif description for our task was as follows:
 
While rigorous tests have identified the Inspection Time task as having the greatest discriminatory ability
by alcohol dose of all psychometric tasks (8), the validity and reliability of this task has not been tested for
mobile devices. The aim of this assignment is to develop an app that would permit the validity and
reliability of the task to be tested.

The task should be brief, easy to use in a busy alcohol setting and performance should not be enhanced
by learning.

At present, no appropriate psychomotor task exists for Android or iPhone/iPad platforms, necessitating
the development of novel app code. Given that Android mobile devices are cheaper and more widely
accessible than iOS apps, the app should be developed for Android devices. Following the development of
the app, longitudinal user feedback will allow us to estimate the utility and impact of the app in
preparation for further evaluation. The capacity to receive user feedback should be built into the app.
Examples of user feedback include perceptions of the usability of the app and perceptions of task validity.
